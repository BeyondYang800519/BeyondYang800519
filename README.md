I vow to both empower and be empowered, to shine brightly in every reach of my ability. For every individual awaiting a brighter, less agonized world, I embrace each opportunity as a step toward this lofty yet luminous goal.

        My name is Emma, I’m currently in eighth grade at BASIS Bilingual School Shenzhen. Biology has been my passion ever since 6th grade, learning about how our body performs day-to-day functions has been a source of fascination to me. Thus, I chose to pursue my passion by entering the iGEM competition. I am one of the experimental leaders in our team, and I am also a part of the HP and promotion video groups. Other than biology, I am also into debate and squash. I have been debating for two years in both PF and BP debates. And I play squash in my free time. I look forward to participating in the iGEM competition.

        Hello everyone, my name is Tianlin Alan Wen, I'm currently a 9th-grade student studying at BASIS International School Park Lane Harbour. One of my favorite extracurricular activities is painting (studying it for 6 years already), and I'm excited to meet great painters and designers. Also, please contact me if you play table tennis (almost nobody plays it in BASIS). It is a great honor to join the iGEM family to further explore biology and have the opportunity to solve global issues that are related to everyone.
