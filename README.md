            My life motto aligns with the meaning of my name, Elaine: shining light, inspiration, a calling to shine one’s light in the world. I vow to both empower and be empowered, to shine brightly in every reach of my ability. For every individual awaiting a brighter, less agonized world, I embrace each opportunity as a step toward this lofty yet luminous goal.

            Hi! My name's Beyond, an ENTJ. I'm in Grade 8 at BASIS International School Sichuan. I enjoy biology, swimming, Chinese traditional painting... In iGEM, I'm responsible for HP, dry lab, and wiki. I know C++ and Python, and I've studied some psychology. Despite being only in 8th grade, I've attempted to learn part of Calculus AB.

           My name is Diarmuid and I am a Grade 9 student in BASIS Bilingual School Shenzhen.  Biology is my favorite subject because exploring life can enhance our understanding of this world. I also like swimming and playing soccer. In my spare time, I will play my violin and read books. I would like to read detective and historical books. I am a positive boy. Talking with others is very such a pleasure for me. I have a good temper and I barely be angry with others.
