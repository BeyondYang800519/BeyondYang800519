    <h1>Project Descriptionï¼š</h1>
    <p>Our project aimed to degrade microplastics through the utilization of PETase, an enzyme capable of degrading PET microplastics. Microplastics are not only a major global environmental challenge but also a relatively underrecognized issue among the public. They cause extensive pollution worldwide and pose significant health risks to all living organisms. PETase facilitates the breakdown of these microplastic polymers into monomers, rendering them harmless to both humans and other organisms. We selected <i>E. coli</i> and cyanobacteria as the chassis for PETase expression to ensure both the efficacy and sustainability of our product. Designed to address this global challenge, our project is intended to be applicable in the real world, with plans to implement it in the oceanic regions.</p>
